  FEEDBACK: you have an example to redirect the user to the default page. You should do that quite quickly.
            Why? Think about the perception of the team. Is it not nice to see a nice, working page instead of
            a default blank page? I know that it may look futile, but it will increase your confidence in the
            quality of your project and in your progress (otherwise, you will have the feeling that you are 
            always in a "broken", "unfinished" state. It is better to have a system that provides very, very
            limited functionality, but which is solid and polished, rather than a system full of half-baked code.
